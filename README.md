# ohmyfood_OC_Project3
This is the third project of Openclassroom's Web Development Bootcamp. We had to build upon our newly acquired HTML and CSS skills in this project by learning SASS, particularly the SCSS syntax and features. Furthermore, we were told to approach the project "mobile-first". This project was challenging yet at the same time fun, I learned how to animate in CSS, and I furthered my GIT knowledge.
